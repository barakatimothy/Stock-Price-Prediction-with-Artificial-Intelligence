**Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning**

    This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical stock data to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to forecast future stock prices.

**Introduction**
    Predicting stock prices is a challenging yet crucial task in financial markets. This project utilizes historical stock data, machine learning algorithms, and Python programming to predict future stock prices. It uses the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data and scikit-learn library to train an SVM model for prediction.

**Features**
    Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
    Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for stock price prediction.
    Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy scores.
    Visualize historical stock prices and predicted prices.

**Requirements**
    Python (>=3.6)
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn
    yfinance

**Installation**
    Clone the repository: https://github.com/barakatimothy/Stock-Price-Prediction-with-Artificial-Intelligence.git

**Requirements**
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

Python (version 3.x)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd stock-price-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
Prepare your historical stock price data in CSV format with columns for date, open price, high price, low price, close price, and volume.

Place the CSV file in the data directory.

Run the train_model.py script to train the prediction model:


python train_model.py
After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions by running the predict.py script:


python predict.py
Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The historical stock price data is preprocessed, including normalization and feature engineering.

Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train a machine learning model, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM).

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data, forecasting short-term stock price movements and potential trends.
