Stock Price Prediction Model Readme
Introduction
This repository contains a simple AI model aimed at predicting short-term stock price movements and potential trends. The model utilizes historical stock price data and employs machine learning techniques to make predictions.

**Requirements**
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

Python (version 3.x)
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd stock-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
Prepare your historical stock price data in CSV format with columns for date, open price, high price, low price, close price, and volume.

Place the CSV file in the data directory.

Run the train_model.py script to train the prediction model:


python train_model.py
After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions by running the predict.py script:


python predict.py
Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The historical stock price data is preprocessed, including normalization and feature engineering.

Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train a machine learning model, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM).

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data, forecasting short-term stock price movements and potential trends.
